        Hi there! I'm <b>Rhythm Babu Kafle</b>, a student of Computer Science with a strong interest in 
        <b>Cyber Security</b>. 
        One day, I stumbled upon the tryhackme website, and I fell into the deep rabbit hole of trying 
        to get better in this field. It aroused a curiosity in me, about how things work behind the scenes,
        and the curiosity never died since then.

        I am interested in <b>Offensive Security</b> and spend my time honing my pentesting skills. I spend
        my time learning how to identify security vulnerabilities, <b>playing ctfs and challenges</b>, solving
        <b>tryhackme</b> and <b>hackthebox</b> machines, and reviewing all the things I've learnt so far.
        
        My goal is to use my knowledge and skills to help organizations protect their critical assets and data,
        and ensuring the arrival of a <b>safer digital world</b>. As I continue my journey in cybersecurity, I am 
        excited about the opportunities to grow, learn and contribute to this ever-growing field.

        Let's connect, collaborate, and make the world a safer place.
